\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of spatial observations \eqn{n}.}

\item{tt}{Number of time observations \eqn{T}.}

\item{rho}{The true \eqn{\rho} parameter}

\item{beta1}{Vector of dimensions \eqn{k_1 \times 1}. Provides the values for \eqn{\beta_1} Defaults
to \code{c()}. Note: has to be fo same length as \eqn{\beta_2}.}

\item{beta2}{Vector of dimensions \eqn{k_1 \times 1}. Provides the values for \eqn{\beta_2} Defaults
to \code{c()}. Note: has to be fo same length as \eqn{\beta_1}.}

\item{beta3}{Vector of dimensions \eqn{k_2 \times 1}. Provides the values for \eqn{\beta_3} Defaults
to \code{c()}.}

\item{sigma2}{The true \eqn{\sigma^2} parameter for the DGP. Has to be a scalar larger than zero.}

\item{n_neighbor}{Number of neighbors for the generated \eqn{n \times n} spatial weight \eqn{W} matrix.
Defaults to 4.}

\item{do_symmetric}{Should the generated spatial weight matrix be symmetric? (default: FALSE)}

\item{intercept}{Should the first column of \eqn{Z} be an intercept? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
If \code{intercept = TRUE}, \eqn{\beta_3} has to be at least of length \code{1}.}

\value{
A list with the generated \eqn{X}, \eqn{Y} and \eqn{W} and a list of parameters.
}
\description{
This function can be used to generate data from a data generating process for SDM,
SAR, SLX type models.
}
\details{
The generated spatial panel model takes the form

\deqn{
Y = \rho W Y + X \beta_1 + W X \beta_2 + Z \beta_3 +  \epsilon,
}

with \eqn{\epsilon \sim N(0,I_n\sigma^2)}. he function generates the \eqn{N \times 1} vector \eqn{Y}.
The elements of the explanatory variable matrices \eqn{X}
(\eqn{N \times k_1}) and \eqn{Z} (\eqn{N \times k_2}) are randomly generated from a Gaussian
distribution with zero mean and unity variance (\eqn{N(0,1)}).

The non-negative, row-stochastic \eqn{n} by \eqn{n} matrix \eqn{W} is constructed using a k-nearest neighbor specification
based on a randomly generated spatial location pattern, with coordinates sampled from a standard normal distribution.

Values for the parameters \eqn{\beta_1}, \eqn{\beta_2}, and \eqn{\beta_3}, as well as
\eqn{\rho} and \eqn{\sigma^2} have to be provided by the user. The length of \eqn{\beta_1} and
\eqn{\beta_2} have to be equal.
\itemize{
\item{A spatial Durbin model (SDM) is constructed if \eqn{\rho} is not equal to zero and
\eqn{\beta_1}, \eqn{\beta_2}, and \eqn{\beta_3} are all supplied by the user.}
\item{A spatial autoregressive model is constructed if \eqn{\rho} is not equal to zero and only
\eqn{\beta_3} is supplied by the user.}
\item{An SLX type model is constructed if \eqn{\rho} is equal to zero and \eqn{\beta_1},
\eqn{\beta_2} are supplied by the user.}
