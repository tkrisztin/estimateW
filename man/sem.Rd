\title{A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler for the panel spatial error model (SEM) with exogenous spatial weight matrix.}
\usage{
sem(
  Y,
  tt,
  W,
  Z = matrix(1, nrow(Y), 1),
  niter = 200,
  nretain = 100,
  rho_prior = rho_priors(),
  beta_prior = beta_priors(k = ncol(Z)),
  sigma_prior = sigma_priors()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{numeric \eqn{N \times 1} matrix containing the dependent variables, where \eqn{N = nT} is the number of
spatial (\eqn{n}) times the number of time observations (\eqn{T}, with \code{tt=T}). Note that the observations
have organized such that \eqn{Y = [Y_1',...,Y_T']'}.}

\item{tt}{single number greater or equal to 1. Denotes the number of time observations. \eqn{tt = T}.}

\item{W}{numeric, non-negative and row-stochastic \eqn{n} by \eqn{n} exogenous spatial weight matrix.
Must have zeros on the main diagonal.}

\item{Z}{numeric \eqn{N \times k_3} design matrix of independent variables which are not
spatially lagged. The default value is a \eqn{N \times 1} vector of ones (i.e. an intercept for the model).}

\item{niter}{single number greater or equal to 1, indicating the total number of draws.
Will be automatically coerced to integer. The default value is 200.}

\item{nretain}{single number greater or equal to 0, indicating the number of draws
kept after the burn-in. Will be automatically coerced to integer. The default value is 100.}

\item{rho_prior}{list of prior settings for estimating \eqn{\rho},
generated by the smart constructor \code{\link{rho_priors}}}

\item{beta_prior}{list containing priors for the slope coefficients \eqn{\beta},
generated by the smart constructor \code{\link{beta_priors}}.}

\item{sigma_prior}{list containing priors for the error variance \eqn{\sigma^2},
generated by the smart constructor \code{\link{sigma_priors}}}
}
\description{
The sampler uses independent Normal-inverse-Gamma priors for the slope and variance parameters,
as well as a four-parameter prior for the spatial autoregressive parameter \eqn{\rho}. The function is
used as an illustration on using the \code{\link{beta_sampler}}, \code{\link{sigma_sampler}},
and \code{\link{rho_sampler}} classes.
}
\details{
The considered panel spatial error model (SEM) takes the form:

\deqn{
 Y_t = Z \beta + \varepsilon_t,
 }

with \eqn{\varepsilon_t \sim N(0,(I_n - \rho W) \sigma^2)}. The row-stochastic \eqn{n} by \eqn{n} spatial weight
matrix \eqn{W} is non-negative and has zeros on the main diagonal. \eqn{\rho} is a scalar spatial autoregressive parameter.

\eqn{Y_t} (\eqn{n \times 1}) collects the \eqn{n} cross-sectional (spatial) observations for time
\eqn{t=1,...,T}. \eqn{Z_t} (\eqn{n \times k_2}) is a
matrix of explanatory variables, where the former will also be spatially lagged.
\eqn{\beta} (\eqn{k_3 \times 1}) is an unknown slope parameter vector.

After vertically staking the \eqn{T} cross-sections  \eqn{Y=[Y_1',...,Y_T']'} (\eqn{N \times 1})
and \eqn{Z=[Z_1', ..., Z_T']'} (\eqn{N \times k_2}),
with \eqn{N=nT}, the final model can be expressed as:

\deqn{
 Y =  Z \beta_3 + \varepsilon,
}

where \eqn{\tilde{W}=I_T \otimes W} and \eqn{\varepsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2 (I_n \otimes (I_n - \rho W)  )}. Note that the input
data matrices have to be ordered first by the cross-sectional spatial units and then stacked by time.
